## How the app works
===
### This app accepts user input to add new portal name, start time and frequency to schedule. Displays schedule in repeating table with next arrival based on current time and frequency of portal opening. Stores portals info in Firebase for data persistence and retreives information from database on load. Schedules refresh every minute to reflect updated arrival information. User can remove portal information from schedule and database with click of button.
